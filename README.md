# AI & ML Internship – Task 2  
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 📌 Objective
To understand the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations, and identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.

---

### 🛠 Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Kaggle Notebook  

---

### 📊 Dataset
Titanic Dataset (Kaggle – Machine Learning from Disaster)

---

### ✅ Steps Performed

1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
2. Generated summary statistics using `describe()` (mean, median, std, etc.).
3. Created histograms to understand data distribution.
4. Used boxplots to detect outliers.
5. Generated correlation heatmap to study relationships between features.
6. Created pairplots for selected numerical features.
7. Made basic observations from visualizations.

---

### 🔍 Key Observations

- Younger passengers had slightly higher survival rates.
- Passengers who paid higher fares showed better survival probability.
- Fare column contains noticeable outliers.
- Age distribution is right-skewed.
- Survival is correlated with passenger class and fare.

### 📈 Conclusion

Exploratory Data Analysis helped in understanding data distribution, detecting outliers, and identifying relationships between features.  
EDA is an essential step before building any machine learning model as it improves feature understanding and overall model performance.
